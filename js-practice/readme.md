# Array Methods Questions

## 1. push() â€“ Add elements to the end

1. Add "orange" and "banana" to the array `fruits = ["apple", "mango"]` and print the result.
2. Create an empty array `numbers`, push `10, 20, 30` into it, and print the array.
3. Push "JavaScript" into the array `skills = ["HTML", "CSS"]` and display the result.
4. Given `obj = { items: ["Item1", "Item2"] }`, push "New Item" into the `items` array and print it.
5. Push `[4, 5, 6]` into `arr1 = [1, 2, 3]` and print the result.

## 2. pop() â€“ Remove the last element

1. Remove and print the last element from `arr = [100, 200, 300]` along with the modified array.
2. Try popping from an empty array `emptyArr = []` and print the result.
3. Remove the last element from `fruits2 = ["apple", "mango", "grapes"]` and print the result.
4. Pop the last element from `nums = [5, 10, 15]`, store it in `lastNum`, and print both.
5. Check if `obj2 = { key: "value" }` supports the `pop()` method and explain the result.

## 3. shift() â€“ Remove the first element

1. Remove the first element from `pets = ["dog", "cat", "rabbit"]` and print the modified array.
2. Shift the first element from `letters = ["A", "B", "C"]` and store it in `firstLetter`, then print it.
3. Try shifting from an empty array `emptyArray = []` and print the result.
4. Remove and print the first two elements from `words = ["one", "two", "three"]`.
5. Shift the first element from `nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and print the modified array.

## 4. unshift() â€“ Add elements to the beginning

1. Add "Start" to `parts = ["Middle", "End"]` using `unshift()` and print the result.
2. Use `unshift()` to add `50, 60` to `numList = [70, 80]` and print the array.
3. Unshift `[4, 5, 6]` into `arr2 = [1, 2, 3]` and print the modified array.
4. Add "start" to the beginning and "end" to the end of `both = [1, 2, 3]`, then print it.
5. Insert "zero" at the beginning of `words2 = ["one", "two"]` and print the result.

## 5. map() â€“ Transform each element

1. Use `map()` to double each element in `nums3 = [10, 20, 30]` and print the result.
2. Convert `celsius = [0, 20, 30]` to Fahrenheit using `map()` and print the new array.
3. Convert `lowerCaseWords = ["apple", "banana"]` to uppercase using `map()`.
4. Extract names from `users = [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}]` using `map()`.
5. Use `map()` to find the length of each string in `strList = ["hello", "world", "JavaScript"]`.

## 6. filter() â€“ Return elements that match a condition

1. Use `filter()` to get even numbers from `nums4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. Filter names with 4 or fewer letters from `names2 = ["Bob", "Jonathan", "Kim"]`.
3. Extract users older than 18 from `users2 = [{age: 15}, {age: 22}, {age: 30}]`.
4. Filter values greater than 50 from `values = [10, 50, 100]`.
5. Try filtering numbers greater than 50 from `[10, 20, 30]` and print the result.

## 7. reduce() â€“ Reduce an array to a single value

1. Use `reduce()` to get the product of numbers in `num5 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
2. Find the maximum value in `num6 = [5, 10, 15, 20]` using `reduce()`.
3. Concatenate `words3 = ["Hello", "World"]` into a sentence using `reduce()`.
4. Count occurrences of numbers in `countNumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
5. Compare the sum of numbers using `map()` and `reduce()` on `numbersArray = [10, 20, 30]`.

## 8. find() â€“ Find the first matching element

1. Find the first number greater than 50 in `num7 = [10, 40, 55, 70]`.
2. Find the first fruit starting with "b" in `fruits3 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
3. Extract the first user older than 25 from `users3 = [{name: "Alice", age: 22}, {name: "Bob", age: 30}]`.
4. Try finding a number greater than 50 in `[10, 20, 30]`.
5. Try finding "D" in `["A", "B", "C"]`.

## 9. some() and every()

1. Check if any number in `num9 = [2, 4, 6, 8]` is odd using `some()`.
2. Check if all numbers in `num10 = [10, 20, 30]` are greater than 5 using `every()`.
3. Check if any word starts with "b" in `words4 = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]` using `some()`.
4. Check if all numbers in an empty array `emptyList = []` are positive using `every()`.
5. Use `some()` and `every()` on `[1, 2, 3]` to check if any/all values are greater than 2.

## 10. sort() â€“ Sort an array

1. Sort `numbers11 = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3]` in ascending order using `sort()`.
2. Sort `words5 = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]` alphabetically.
3. Sort `users4 = [{age: 30}, {age: 20}, {age: 40}]` by age using `sort()`.
4. Sort `num12 = [100, 25, 300, 4]` and explain the output.
5. Sort `[4, 2, 10, 8]` in descending order using `sort()`.
