        "area": "Performance",
        "suggestion": "Instead of modifying `display.innerHTML` multiple times in `render()`, build a string and update it once for better performance."
      },
      {
        "area": "Code Clarity",
        "suggestion": "Use descriptive function names. For example, `calculateScrewQty()` could be renamed to `computeScrewRequirements()` for better readability."
      },
      {
        "area": "Edge Case Handling",
        "suggestion": "Ensure all inputs are valid numbers. If a user inputs a non-numeric value, handle it gracefully with `isNaN()` checks."
      },
      {
        "area": "Reusability",
        "suggestion": "Extract `render()` as a standalone function outside `displayDetails()` so it can be reused in other parts of the project if needed."

        "area": "User Experience",
        "suggestion": "Show an error message if any required field is empty instead of proceeding with calculations."
